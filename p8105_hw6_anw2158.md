The plot shows the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for solving homicides in
various cities, comparing male to female victims. A significant
variation in ORs across cities is observed, with some cities more likely
to solve homicides involving male victims, while others show the
opposite trend or no clear disparity. Points with confidence intervals
not crossing the OR of 1 indicate statistically significant differences
in the likelihood of solving cases based on victim gender. Notably, New
York, NY, shows a much higher likelihood of solving homicides with
female victims, whereas cities like Albuquerque, NM, display a higher
likelihood when victims are male. The wide range of confidence intervals
suggests varying degrees of certainty about these estimates, emphasizing
the need to consider local context and data quality when interpreting
these findings.
